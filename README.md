Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind.
It is developed by the Berkeley Vision and Learning Center ([BVLC](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu)) and community contributors.

Check out the [project site](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) for all the details like

备注：python3版本，在docker u16.04_x86_64_cv3.4_py3_caffessd:v2中运行，模型确实压缩了，由于没有数据训练alexnet，所以没办法评估速度加速多少。
